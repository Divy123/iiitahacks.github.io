       <p class="Text Text--large u-marginTop-x2" style="text-align: justify;">Hackathon is an event, typically lasting several days, in which a large number of people meet to engage in collaborative computer programming. The concept of the hackathon was born out of the open source community.</p>
       <p class="Text Text--large " style="text-align: justify;">This time on popular demand IIIT-A is organising a mini hacakthon for its students, a 20 hour long event. The hackathon would inspire you to imagine, design, code and create. So it time to show the magic in your fingers and create the project you have always thought of, or discussed with your friend on the late night intellectual tea breaks, or anything random which is too crazy to be ignored.</p>
